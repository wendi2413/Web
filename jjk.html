        <p1>When I decided to start watching JJk, I was aware of the opinions about it going around. This anime was very popular when it released, just like its manga. Many stated that it's "overhyped", even though a lot people love it. It ended up surpassing largely my expectations, and I really love the anime now. I do agree it might be a little bit overhyped, but I stand that it's still a very good story. I really started liking the story when the older students showed up and fell in love while watching the <em>Sisters School Exchange Event</em>. I will definitively watch the JJK0 Movie. I love many characters, but I feel like my favourites aren't the same level as Haikyu's. I think the story was moving really fast and I didn't have the time to really bond with a specific character. Among the tops, I have Itadori, Gojo, Inumaki, Nanami, and Panda.</p1><br/><br/>
        <p2><em>UPDATE</em>: After watching JJK0, my favourite character has now become Inumaki and Yuta has also taken up a special place in my heart. In my opinion, JJk0 is very well made and I love the plot and story line. Inumaki's really made an impression on me and I have made it my favourite character :). Yuta is the nicest person ever and his character development really made me happy. Overall, I'm really immersed in their universe now.</p2><br/><br/>
        <p3>Some information about JJK season 2: it's gonna be released on July 2023!! It's probably gonna contain 24-26 episodes seperated into 2 cours of 13 episodes. It will cover the <em>The Shibuya Incident Arc</em>starting from the 8th volume in the manga series. Another good news is that the manga series is still ongoing, the latest volume published being the 19th on April 4th 2022.</p3>

            JJK is a very popular manga and anime series that has a huge fandom from everywhere around the world. Popularities polls has being done to determine the favorites. The one you have before your eyes is the more recent one dating from december 13, 2021. The fourth column establishes a link with the previous poll: since most characters in the top5 of this poll have also been present in the previous top5, I have indicated that it is their second time being on the podium. As for the last column, it's my personal preference ranking of the characters in top5, but I have more preferred characters who are sadly not in the top5.
