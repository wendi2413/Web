        <h3>Personal Appreciation</h3>
        <div class="paragraphs">
        <p1>Spy X Family is a bit different from the previous ones, and that's what made me really like it. Despite my love for action filles series, I will always love an anime that shows little adventures in a big quest. It's what Spy X Family gave me. There is a general mission, but there is still a lot of episodes that just shows us how the characters get closer, breaks from the action. It's a comic show too, another one of its many qualities. I really like all the characters for this show and find it very hard to pick favourites. The story itself is very sweet and heartwarming. I really hope that they will all remain together after Loid's mission and become one big family. I now know Twilight's personnality as a spy, and it's admirable, but I really do want him to retire and stay with them. I will respect his choice to remain a spy and move on though, if that's what happens.</p1>

        <h3>Infos</h3>
        <div class="paragraphs">
            <p2>Season 2 should be released in 2023, which is quite surprising, as it usually take years to elaborate a season. On top of that, news is that we will also be getting a movie! Even is there is no specific release date announced yet.</p2><br/><br/>
            <p3>Season 1 covered about 6 volumes, 37 chapters of the manga, and predictions say that the second season shall cover about the same amount of content. As of right now, only 10 volumes are out, since Spy X Family is a pretty recent manga series (started March 25 2019). Chapters 37-72 are still unadapted, which is going to be enough content for a second season.</p3><br/><br/>
